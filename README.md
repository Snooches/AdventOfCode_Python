# AdventOfCode_Python
This is just a project to refresh my python skills. I will use coding problems from www.adventofcode.com for training purposes starting with the 2018 event.

While I will try to adhere to python coding standards and best-practices I might not always be aware of all of them.
Also since I'm just getting back in python coding these solutions are most likely not as sophisticated as they could be, hopefully that changes as I go along...
